# Ninjarunner

Using HTML, Javascript and Construct 2 game developing software, I made my first small web game when study with MSA (Microsoft Student Accelerator).

Control Instruction: Key-- Z for jump (double press double jump) , Key--X for speed up ( Ninjar could destroy the block when running in the Max speed ).

Ninja Runner is available online! 
Just click and play!
